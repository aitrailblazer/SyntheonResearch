The repository contains the **SyntheonResearch** project, which implements a purely symbolic approach for solving
ARC-AGI tasks. According to its README, Syntheon uses deterministic reasoning and task-specific rule learning without
relying on language models. Key principles include advanced preprocessing with structured XML metadata, multi-tier
symbolic rules, size-class heuristics, and symmetry-guided transformations. The repository also includes ARC-AGI
training and evaluation data under `arc_agi2_symbolic_submission/arc-prize-2025`.
