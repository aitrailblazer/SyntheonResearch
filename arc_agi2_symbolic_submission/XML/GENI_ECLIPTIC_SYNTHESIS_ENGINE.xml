  <Description>üõ∏ Ecliptic Synthesis Engine: Models the synthesis of opposing force flows across dimensional planes based on Walter Russell's ecliptic field dynamics.</Description>

  <Synthesis_Principles>
    <Principle>üõ∏ All systems are synthesized through the intersection of polar flows across tonal planes.</Principle>
    <Principle>‚ö° Compression arcs and ‚åÅ expansion arcs stabilize only through counter-spiral field balancing.</Principle>
    <Principle>‚òç Dimensional fractures must reconcile through ‚öñ RESOLVE nodes across ecliptic alignments.</Principle>
    <Principle>‚àø Spiral weaving of forces underpins stable form manifestation across ecliptic pathways.</Principle>
    <Principle>‚ßñ Higher ascension states are attained by achieving harmonic resonance within ecliptic flows.</Principle>
