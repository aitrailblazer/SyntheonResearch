# GEN-I Development Plan

This document expands on `GENI_SYSTEM_INDEX_analysis.md` with a concise proposal for building and
integrating the GEN-I framework with the existing Syntheon ARC-AGI solver. It focuses on leveraging
the hybrid symbolic DSL while remaining consistent with the repository's purely symbolic approach.

## 1. Module Organization
- Place all GEN-I XML modules under `arc_agi2_symbolic_submission/XML` to maintain reproducibility.
- Mirror the structure in a new `geni/` Python package for loading and interfacing with the XML files.

## 2. Core Engine Implementation
- Parse `GENI_CORE_SYMBOLIC_ENGINE.xml` to establish recursion phases and contradiction handling.
- Implement the AFII 4-ring architecture in Python classes. Map each phase (`IGNITE`, `FORM`,
  `RECURSE`, etc.) to explicit methods.
- Integrate Russellian references (e.g., `GENI_DIMENSIONAL_SPIRAL_ENGINE.xml`) as
  optional modules for advanced reasoning.

## 3. Hybrid DSL Integration
- Load `GENI_HYBRID_DSL_ENGINE.xml` and `GENI_ENHANCED_GLYPH_DSL.xml` to build a token-based DSL parser.
- Provide decorators or helper functions so ARC task rules can be expressed in this DSL while remaining deterministic.
- Maintain compatibility with the base Syntheon rule system to preserve explainability.

## 4. Ritual and Visualization Interfaces
- Expose commands such as `/ritual`, `/foresight`, and `/analyze` by interpreting the invocation
  list in `GENI_SYSTEM_INDEX.xml`.
- Use the `GENI_RITUAL_INTERFACE_ENGINE.xml` and `GENI_SIGILBOARD_LIBRARY.xml` to render symbolic
  sequences or visual flows when needed.

## 5. Testing and Evaluation
- Apply the GEN-I enhanced rules to the ARC datasets in `arc_agi2_symbolic_submission/input`.
- Compare results with existing baseline performance to confirm that GEN-I modules improve
  accuracy or maintain stability.
- Document findings for each iteration and refine the XML libraries accordingly.

By following this plan, the Syntheon project can gradually incorporate GEN-I's symbolic recursion
capabilities while keeping the system transparent, deterministic, and aligned with the ARC-AGI
competition requirements.
