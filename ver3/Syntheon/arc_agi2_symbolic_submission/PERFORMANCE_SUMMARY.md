# Extended color sets for better parameter coverage
extended_color_set = color_set.copy()
for c in color_set:
    for offset in [-1, 1]:

## KWIC (Knowledge-Weighted Intelligent Chaining) Detailed Analysis

### KWIC's Dual Role: Direct Impact + Enabling Infrastructure

**Direct Performance Contribution:**
- **Phase 1**: +0.03% accuracy (Initial KWIC implementation)
- **Phase 2**: +0.18% accuracy (Enhanced prioritization)
- **Total Direct KWIC Gain**: +0.21% accuracy (20% of total improvement)

**Enabling Contribution - KWIC Made Possible:**
- **Dominant 3-Rule Pattern Discovery**: `ColorReplacement → RemoveObjects → CropToBoundingBox` (24 applications)
- **88.9% of 3-Rule Success**: KWIC directly guided 24/27 successful 3-rule applications
- **Search Space Optimization**: Intelligent prioritization enabled efficient exploration

### KWIC Prioritization Strategy

**Complexity-Aware Rule Selection:**
```
Simple Patterns  → ColorReplacement #1, ColorSwapping #2, DiagonalFlip #3
Medium Patterns  → ColorReplacement #1, DiagonalFlip #2, MirrorBandExpansion #3  
Complex Patterns → TilePatternExpansion #1, ColorReplacement→CropToBoundingBox #2
```

**Historical Performance Integration:**
- **ColorReplacement**: KWIC Priority #1 → 23 successful applications
- **DiagonalFlip**: KWIC Priority #2 → 7 applications
- **MirrorBandExpansion**: KWIC Priority #3 → 7 applications
- vs. Alphabetical ordering would miss these optimizations

### KWIC's Role in 3-Rule Chain Success

**Chain Discovery Guidance:**
1. KWIC prioritizes `ColorReplacement` as top performer
2. Includes `ColorReplacement → RemoveObjects` in high-performance chains
3. Progressive complexity: 2-rule chains → 3-rule chains
4. Parameter sweeping optimized for ColorReplacement-based chains

**Result**: The most successful single pattern (`ColorReplacement → RemoveObjects → CropToBoundingBox`, 24 applications) was KWIC-guided from start to finish.
