# Enhanced Rule Prediction System: Version 2.0

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the ARC-AGI2 symbolic solver's rule prediction system, building upon the
previous version. The enhanced system leverages the 7-component advanced preprocessing data to more accurately identify
applicable rules and their parameters.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Transformation Type to Rule Mapping

- **Extended Mappings**: Each rule now maps to multiple, more specific transformation types
- **Pattern-Specific Mapping**: Added specialized mappings for each transformation pattern
- **Hierarchical Type Recognition**: Improved recognition of transformation types across levels of abstraction

### 2. Confidence-Weighted Rule Prioritization

- **Position-Based Confidence**: Rules earlier in the prediction list get higher confidence
- **Multi-Component Scoring**: Uses all 7 preprocessing components to calculate confidence
- **Adaptive Prioritization**: Adjusts rule priorities based on grid properties and preprocessing confidence

### 3. Sophisticated Parameter Extraction

- **Grid-Aware Parameter Inference**: Analyzes input/output grids to infer parameters
- **Pattern Detection**: Added detection of repeating units and symmetry properties
- **Rule-Specific Parameter Handling**: Specialized parameter extraction for each rule type
- **Parameter Validation**: Uses output grid to validate and refine parameter suggestions

### 4. Rule Chain Recommendation System

- **Expanded Chain Library**: More rule chains based on transformation patterns
- **Primary Rule Integration**: Builds chains using primary rules from preprocessing
- **Confidence-Weighted Recommendations**: Prioritizes chains based on confidence scores
- **Chain Diversity**: Ensures diverse rule combinations for better coverage

### 5. Adaptive Feedback Integration

- **Grid Property Adjustment**: Adjusts rule confidence based on grid size, color count, and symmetry
- **Success Rate Tracking**: Considers historical performance of rules
- **Transformation Consistency**: Evaluates consistency between transformation predictions and rules

## Implementation Details

### New Functions

1. **detect_repeating_unit**: Identifies repeating patterns in grids for tiling rules
   - Analyzes both horizontal and vertical repetition
   - Capable of detecting 2D repetition patterns
   - Returns the dimensions of the smallest repeating unit

2. **is_horizontally_symmetric/is_vertically_symmetric**: Detects symmetry for geometric rules
   - Handles both even and odd-sized grids
   - Returns both a boolean flag and a symmetry score (0.0-1.0)
   - Works with partial symmetry (> 80% matching cells)

3. **format_parameters_for_engine**: Ensures parameters are correctly formatted for the engine
   - Handles special parameter formats for different rule types
   - Converts between string, numeric, and array parameter formats

4. **add_rule_specific_parameters**: Adds specialized parameters for specific rules
   - Uses grid analysis to infer missing parameters
   - Provides rule-specific default values when appropriate

5. **get_adaptive_rule_priority**: Dynamically prioritizes rules based on preprocessing and grid properties
   - Considers grid dimensions, color count, and symmetry
   - Integrates with primary rule predictions from preprocessing
   - Creates category-specific rule subsets based on grid characteristics
   - Dynamically adjusts priorities based on detected features

### Enhanced Existing Functions

1. **extract_transformation_parameters**: Now uses weighted scoring for prediction matching
2. **enhance_parameters_with_grid_analysis**: More sophisticated parameter inference from grids
3. **get_rule_confidence_from_preprocessing**: Improved confidence calculation with nuanced scoring
4. **get_recommended_rule_chains**: Expanded rule chains with specialized combinations

## Expected Impact

The enhanced rule prediction system is expected to improve the ARC-AGI2 solver's performance in several ways:

1. **Higher Accuracy**: More precise rule selection and parameter extraction
2. **Fewer Iterations**: More effective prioritization reduces the number of rules tried
3. **Better Complex Task Handling**: Improved handling of multi-step transformations
4. **More Robust Parameter Inference**: Better handling of edge cases and complex parameters

## Usage

To use the enhanced rule prediction system:

1. Run the precomputation script to generate the enhanced XML
   ```bash
   python precompute_advanced_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. The main solver will automatically use the enhanced parameter extraction and rule prioritization

3. For best results, ensure the advanced preprocessing system is properly configured

## Technical Notes

- The system maintains backward compatibility with the existing solver
- The enhancements focus on improving rule selection and parameter extraction without changing the rule implementations
- The adaptive prioritization system adjusts based on both preprocessing results and grid properties

## Future Directions

1. Integrate machine learning for parameter prediction
2. Add automatic rule discovery from successful examples
3. Implement error correction for parameter inference
4. Develop specialized parameter extraction for new rule types
5. Create a feedback loop to improve preprocessing based on rule success/failure

## Testing and Validation

### Unit Testing

The enhanced rule prediction system includes a comprehensive test suite in `tests_enhanced_extraction.py` that
validates:

1. **Symmetry Detection**: Tests for perfect symmetry, partial symmetry, and non-symmetric grids
2. **Repeating Unit Detection**: Tests for horizontal, vertical, and 2D pattern repetition
3. **Adaptive Rule Prioritization**: Tests that rules are properly prioritized based on grid properties
4. **Parameter Extraction**: Tests parameter extraction from preprocessing data

### Performance Testing

A comprehensive performance testing framework (`run_performance_tests.sh`) has been implemented to evaluate the system
with different configurations:

1. **Baseline**: Tests the original system without enhancements
2. **Enhanced Parameters**: Tests with only enhanced parameter extraction
3. **Adaptive Priority**: Tests with only adaptive rule prioritization
4. **Full Enhanced**: Tests with all enhancements enabled

The testing framework generates detailed reports comparing the success rates of different configurations, helping to
identify the optimal settings for the system.

### Integration Testing

The enhanced rule prediction system is fully integrated with the main solver through:

1. **Enhanced Parameter Extraction**: `extract_transformation_parameters` function is called during rule application
2. **Adaptive Rule Prioritization**: `get_adaptive_rule_priority` function is used to prioritize rules before testing
3. **Rule Chain Recommendations**: `get_recommended_rule_chains` provides rule chains to try first

This integration ensures that the enhancements benefit the entire solving process without requiring changes to the core
rule implementations.

## Performance Impact

Initial testing shows that the enhanced rule prediction system provides significant improvements:

1. **Success Rate**: Improved accuracy in solving ARC tasks
2. **Efficiency**: Reduced number of rule attempts before finding a solution
3. **Parameter Accuracy**: More precise parameter values leading to fewer invalid rule applications
4. **Complex Task Handling**: Better performance on multi-step transformations through improved rule chains

The most significant improvements are seen in tasks involving:
- Symmetrical patterns
- Repeating tile patterns
- Complex geometric transformations
- Multi-step color transformations

The comprehensive performance testing allows for continuous optimization of the system based on empirical results.
