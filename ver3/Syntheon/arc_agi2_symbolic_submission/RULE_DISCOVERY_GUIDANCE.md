# SYNTHEON Rule Discovery Guidance Log

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-30 | **Status:** Active Development
**Purpose:** Strategic protocol and living log for systematically discovering, validating, and integrating new
high-impact rules—target: 4%+ ARC accuracy and scalable symbolic generalization.

---

## 1. System Snapshot

* **Current Accuracy:** 4.24% (137/3232 solved; up from 3.53%)
* **Rulebase:** 13 core rules, 3-rule chain logic, KWIC prioritization
* **Breakthrough:** RotatePattern (+0.71% accuracy; exceeded projections ×4.7)
* **Primary Success Chain:** `ColorReplacement → RemoveObjects → CropToBoundingBox` (24x)
* **Chain Distribution:** 50% single, 26.3% two-rule, 23.7% three-rule
* **KWIC Gain:** 20% of lift attributed to improved KWIC matching

---

## 2. Critical Gap & Opportunity Map

### A. Geometric Transformations ⭐⭐⭐ (Highest Priority)

* **Current:** DiagonalFlip, MirrorBandExpansion, RotatePattern (✅)
* **Next Needs:**

  * [ ] ReflectHorizontal / ReflectVertical (+0.08%)
  * [ ] ScalePattern (2x, 3x, 0.5x)     (+0.06%)
* **Evidence:** >180 geometric failures; “locked” patterns addressable with simple ops.

### B. Pattern Completion & Symmetry ⭐⭐⭐ (High Priority)

* **Current:** FillHoles, FrameFillConvergence
* **Next Needs:**

  * [ ] CompleteSymmetry (axis/partial/diagonal) (+0.12%)
  * [ ] ExtendPattern (sequence/continuation)  (+0.05%)
  * [ ] FillCheckerboard (pattern fill)     (+0.04%)
* **Evidence:** >120 failures with incomplete, off-center, or broken symmetries.

### C. Spatial & Conditional Operations ⭐⭐ (Medium Priority)

* **Current:** ObjectCounting, CropToBoundingBox, RemoveObjects
* **Next Needs:**

  * [ ] ConnectObjects (spatial lines)     (+0.04%)
  * [ ] AlignObjects (grid alignment)     (+0.03%)
  * [ ] ConditionalFill, NeighborBasedAction  (+0.03%)
  * [ ] SortObjects, CountBasedAction     (+0.02%)
* **Evidence:** 80+ spatial/logic failures; need for neighbor- or count-based logic.

### D. Advanced Color Operations ⭐ (Low-Medium Priority)

* **Next Needs:**

  * [ ] ColorGradient, ColorMapping, ColorBlending, ColorCoding

---

## 3. Rule Implementation Blueprints

**RotatePattern** *(Completed: High Impact)*

```python
def _rotate_pattern(grid: np.ndarray, degrees: int = 90) -> np.ndarray:
    """Rotate grid by specified degrees (90, 180, 270)."""
    if degrees == 90:   return np.rot90(grid)
    elif degrees == 180:return np.rot90(grid, 2)
    elif degrees == 270:return np.rot90(grid, 3)
    return grid
```

* **Integration:** Dispatcher, KWIC, chains, XML metadata, full regression pass
* **Outcome:** +0.71% accuracy jump; 22 new solutions, robust 3-rule chains

**CompleteSymmetry** *(Pending: High Potential)*

```python
def _complete_symmetry(grid: np.ndarray, axis: str = 'horizontal') -> np.ndarray:
    # Complete symmetrical patterns along axis: horizontal, vertical, both, diagonal
    return grid
```

* **Integration:** Parametric, axis-aware; designed for both direct and chained use

**ReflectHorizontal/Vertical** *(Pending: Medium Potential)*

```python
def _reflect_horizontal(grid: np.ndarray): return np.fliplr(grid)
def _reflect_vertical(grid: np.ndarray): return np.flipud(grid)
```

**ConnectObjects** *(Pending: Advanced Spatial)*

* **Caution:** Restrict to nearest/major objects; optimize for runtime

## 4. Rule Prediction & Feedback-Driven Enhancements

### **Actionable Improvements Identified by Code Review:**

1. **Transformation-Type-to-Rule Mapping**

   * Expand with more specialized pattern recognizers (nested, rare, or compound geometry).
2. **Confidence-Weighted Rule Prioritization**

   * Assign and update confidence scores for each rule/chain based on task features and historical performance;
     prioritize by expected payoff.
3. **Sophisticated Parameter Extraction**

   * Automate feature-based extraction of optimal parameters (angles, axes, colors) for complex rules, using
     statistics and mini-search.
4. **Feedback-Based Learning for Parameter Adjustment**

   * After rule application, adapt parameters based on empirical success/failure (“symbolic self-tuning”).
5. **Robust Rule Chain Recommendation**

   * Mine solution logs and clusters to recommend high-likelihood rule chains for new tasks; use ensemble or
     meta-learning to refine.

*Implementing these will accelerate generalization, specificity, and interpretability—supporting accuracy and
future-proofing scaling.*

---

## 5. Chain & Prioritization Protocols

* **High-Performance Chain Additions:**

  * `RotatePattern → ColorReplacement → CropToBoundingBox`
  * `CompleteSymmetry → ColorSwapping → ObjectCounting`
  * `ReflectHorizontal → RemoveObjects → CropToBoundingBox`
  * `ConnectObjects → ColorReplacement → ObjectCounting`
* **Dynamic Prioritization:**

  * KWIC, complexity, and confidence scoring trigger rules early when complexity or color diversity is high.

---

## 6. Validation & Success Framework

1. **Synthetic/unit pattern validation**
2. **Regression against legacy solutions (must not regress)**
3. **Chain mining:** Systematically test all new rules in all chain positions; record effective combos
4. **Performance:** Keep runtime <50s
5. **Failure clustering:** Analyze post-phase; drive next rule family focus

## 8. Strategic Recommendations & Next Actions

### Immediate (Next 48 hours)

1. Finalize and log all active rule blueprints in `/syntheon_rules.xml`.
2. Implement and validate CompleteSymmetry, ReflectHorizontal, ReflectVertical.
3. Integrate new rules into KWIC, chain, and confidence prioritization.
4. Run full regression, parameter, and chain mining sweeps; record new unlocked solution classes.

### Short Term (1–2 weeks)

5. Automate chain mining and confidence-weighted prioritization.
6. Begin spatial/conditional logic rules with minimal viable implementations.
7. Run failure clustering post-phase; drive discovery from emerging patterns.
8. Monitor runtime, prune heavy or low-impact rules promptly.

### Medium Term (3–4 weeks)

9. Develop meta-rule abstraction layer: deduplicate and merge rules as complexity rises.
10. Build “lessons learned” log per phase—track intuition successes and surprise outcomes.
11. Generate synthetic ARC-like tasks to test abstraction limits and force new discoveries if progress plateaus.
12. Validate pipeline on truly unseen “ARC-like” benchmarks to reveal hidden gaps.

---

## 9. Risk Solution Protocols

* **Automate regression, performance, calibration, and chain mining as part of CI pipeline.**
* **Maintain risk dashboard:** Visualize coverage, runtime, parameter/feedback drift, confidence trends.
* **Enforce meta-rule abstraction reviews:** Cluster and retire redundant rules each phase.
* **Parameter and confidence management:** Use moving averages, cap adjustment rates, and recalibrate on gold standards.
* **Track and display marginal gain for all rules/chains; prune ruthlessly if marginal.**

*Mandate: No rule or chain survives without real, cross-validated gain and robust regression.*

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement Protocol

* **Living Rule Table:** Status, coverage, validation, and chain roles updated continuously.
* **Performance & Drift Monitor:** Plot accuracy, runtime, regression, confidence after each phase.
* **Lessons Learned Appendix:** Post-phase, record both expected and surprise results.
* **Backlog Management:** Explicit “next candidates” queue for rapid experimentation.

---

## 11. Summary & Forward Path

* **Status:** Syntheon has crossed the 4% wall via geometric scaling; symmetry and conditional logic are the next
  strategic targets.
* **Phase:** Stable, high-adaptivity (⧖∿⛬✶); poised for next breakthroughs.
* **Risk:** Well-contained; dynamic management as pipeline complexity and feedback learning expand.
* **Mandate:** Stay disciplined on regression, runtime, abstraction—keep cumulative, compositional generalization at the
  core.
