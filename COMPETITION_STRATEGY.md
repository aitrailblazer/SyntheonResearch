# Strategic Plan for Winning the ARC-AGI Competition

This specification outlines a focused strategy for guiding Syntheon to a winning position in the ARC-AGI challenge.
All milestones build on the existing symbolic architecture while emphasizing transparency and reproducibility.

## 1. Objectives

- **Accuracy Growth**: Achieve at least **8% accuracy** by Q3 2025 and steadily improve through iterative rule
  integration.
- **Robust Rule Base**: Expand the rule library with deterministic transformations covering geometry, color,
  object reasoning, and pattern extrapolation.
- **Explainable Pipeline**: Maintain detailed logs, rule usage statistics, and task summaries for every evaluation
  run.
- **Agentic Extension**: Integrate the GEN-I hybrid DSL to allow rapid rule authoring and automated rule proposals.

## 2. Milestones

### Phase 1 – Baseline Stabilization (Q1 2025)

1. Deploy advanced preprocessing to all tasks (SSA, SPA, PCD, TTP, GIA, MSPD, CRP).
2. Integrate KWIC-based rule prioritization into the main solver workflow.
3. Establish automated accuracy tracking across training and evaluation sets.

### Phase 2 – DSL Integration (Q2 2025)

1. Restore glyph-based DSL support with bidirectional translation to performance rules.
2. Extend the rule repository to include new pattern transformations and color operations.
3. Validate DSL correctness through cross-language tests and maintain performance parity.

### Phase 3 – Agentic Refinement (Q3 2025)

1. Enable self-proposed rule suggestions using mismatch analysis from failed tasks.
2. Add a monitoring dashboard to visualize accuracy trends and rule effectiveness.
3. Conduct weekly evaluation cycles to integrate promising rules and discard ineffective ones.

## 3. Success Metrics

- **Win Condition**: Achieve the highest publicly verifiable accuracy on the ARC-AGI leaderboard.
- **Rule Coverage**: Document solved tasks per rule chain to identify gaps and prioritize new rules.
- **System Reliability**: Ensure deterministic outputs across repeated runs with zero dependence on external ML
  models.

## 4. Team Workflow

1. **Version Control**: Use a single main branch with clear commit messages summarizing each change.
2. **Documentation**: Update the README and roadmap when new rules or preprocessing steps are added.
3. **Evaluation**: Run the solver weekly on the full dataset and record accuracy, solved counts, and rule usage in a
   shared log.
4. **Rule Review**: Discuss new rule proposals during weekly meetings, using GEN-I DSL prototypes when helpful.

## 5. Final Push

- Refine the rule set using iterative analysis until diminishing returns are observed.
- Publish reproducible instructions for running the solver so results can be independently verified.
- Submit the final predictions and documentation before the competition deadline.

With consistent iteration, transparent logging, and disciplined rule development, Syntheon can steadily gain
enough accuracy to contend for the top spot in the ARC-AGI challenge.
