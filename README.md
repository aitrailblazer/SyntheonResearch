Certainly. Here's a refined version of your Syntheon system description with clarity, precision, and structure suitable for both technical and executive audiences:

## **Syntheon ARC-AGI Symbolic Predictor**

**Syntheon** is a *purely symbolic* prediction system designed to solve ARC-AGI tasks using deterministic reasoning, structured pattern recognition, and task-specific rule learning. It operates without LLM dependencies, ensuring explainable, reproducible predictions suitable for rigorous evaluation and competition-grade benchmarks.

---

### **Core Principles**

* **🧠 Pure Symbolic Reasoning**
  No learning from language models—Syntheon operates on interpretable symbolic logic.

* **⚙️ Advanced Preprocessing Integration**
  Fully utilizes structured XML metadata for each ARC task, enabling entropy profiling, grid fingerprinting, and directional analysis.

* **🔍 Task-Specific Symbolic Learning**
  Each `<arc_agi_task>` is treated independently. Rules are extracted solely from `training_examples`, never from `test_examples`.

* **🎨 KWIC Pattern Detection**
  Symbolic analysis of **K**ey **W**ords **I**n **C**ontext (KWIC): identifying color co-occurrence, adjacency, and propagation logic.

* **🧱 Multi-Tier Rule Architecture**
  Symbolic rules are layered:

  * *Primary rules*: core transformations.
  * *Secondary rules*: edge case handling, exception filters.

* **📏 Size-Class Optimization**
  Specialized heuristics for `TINY`, `SMALL`, and `LARGE` task categories (based on grid dimensions and complexity).

* **🔁 Symmetry-Guided Processing**
  Transformation strategies guided by mirror, rotational, and translational symmetry detection within input-output pairs.

---

### **Dataset Specification**

* Input file: `arc_agi2_training_enhanced.xml`
* Contains: **1000 `<arc_agi_task>` blocks**

  * Each task includes:

    * `<training_examples>` — used for symbolic rule extraction
    * `<test_examples>` — used *only* for output validation

---

### **Final Objective**

* Develop generalized symbolic rules from the training examples of each task.
* Use these rules to predict the correct `output` for each test input.
* *Do not use* `test_examples` outputs for rule learning—only for correctness verification after inference.

## Running the Solver

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install numpy` if not already available.
3. Run the solver on the training dataset:

```bash
python -m syntheon.main arc_agi2_symbolic_submission/input/arc_agi2_training_enhanced.xml predictions.json
```

This command parses the XML tasks, applies the current rule set, and writes predictions to `predictions.json`.
