# Syntheon Python Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the recommended steps for implementing the symbolic ARC-AGI solver in Python.
It expands on the core principles described in the README.

## 1. Environment Setup
- Use Python 3.x with standard libraries (e.g., `xml.etree.ElementTree`, `numpy` for grid data structures).
- Create a project workspace that includes the datasets in `arc_agi2_symbolic_submission/input`.
- Maintain a clean repository structure for scripts, rule modules, and data.

## 2. Data Ingestion
- Load `arc_agi2_training_enhanced.xml` which contains **1000 `<arc_agi_task>` blocks**.
- Parse each task using an XML parser to extract training and test grids.
- Represent each grid as a 2D array with color values or symbols.

## 3. Preprocessing
- Implement grid fingerprinting and entropy profiling to characterize tasks.
- Detect key directional or symmetry features early to guide rule search.

## 4. Symbolic Rule Extraction
- From `training_examples`, identify deterministic transformations.
- Encode these transformations as reusable Python functions or classes.
- Organize rules into a multi-tier system (primary rules for general cases, secondary rules for exceptions).

## 5. Size-Class and Symmetry Heuristics
- Categorize tasks as `TINY`, `SMALL`, or `LARGE` based on grid dimensions.
- Use mirror, rotational, and translational symmetry detection to narrow candidate rules.

## 6. Prediction Pipeline
- For each test grid, apply the learned rules to generate an output grid.
- Compare predictions against the ground-truth solutions provided in `arc-prize-2025` to evaluate accuracy.

## 7. Iterative Refinement
- Track prediction statistics to identify weak spots in the rule base.
- Add or adjust rules and preprocessing steps to increase coverage.
- Repeat until the system achieves consistent performance across all tasks.

## 8. Glyph Rule Integration
- Load `syntheon_rules_glyphs.xml` to access a library of reusable symbolic rules.
- Each rule includes a `glyph_chain` for visualization and deterministic pseudo code.
- Incorporate these rules into the Python implementation as specialized modules.

Following this roadmap should result in a purely symbolic system that learns directly from ARC-AGI training examples
and verifies predictions using the provided solutions.
